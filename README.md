# smith-home-dashboard

Some of the widgets on here are based on https://github.com/gcosta74/appdaemon-widgets, keeping the same license.

I have added a combosonos and a nest specific one, both with things still to be done.

I also pulled the base_day_forecast in from the forums on https://community.home-assistant.io/c/third-party/hadashboard, but can't find the reference now.
